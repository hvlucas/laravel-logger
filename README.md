## # Laravel Logger v1.0

Laravel Logger was made to keep track of Model history! When you have an application with multiple user roles, it is important to know who made changes to the application Database. Laravel Logger can help you do that with an easy setup!

With Laravel Logger you can:
  - Keep track of of model change history
  - Have a clean front-end to view model changes
  - Sync model with previous states
  - Export model history (CSV, PDF) from a Date Range or its full history
  - View everything from a clean and responsive front-end

## # Configuration

There are a few configurations that can be set from the get-go. They are all optional, but will improve flexibility. Since Laravel Logger is configured at compiler-time (when your application's Service Providers are being booted), it is **important to setup your config file before running php artisan migrate (first time installation).** Otherwise, it will try to auto-discover models in your `app/` directory, and create a copy of each database row available.   
Each model row will have a `startpoint`. Meaning from the moment Laravel Logger's service provider boots up, it will try to find a model instance which has not started its tracking yet. Which is why it would be benefitial for you to fully understand the configuration!

| Config | Type | Default | What it does |
|------|----|-------|------------|
|route_prefix|*string*|"events"|Route prefix which the list of events is going to be. `https://{server_domain}/{your_custom_prefix}/list/`|
|log_connection|*string*|`null`|If you wish to store model instances in a different database you create a connection in `config/database.php`.|
|table_name|*string*|"logged_events"|Name of Event table that is going to be created.|
|user_model|*string*|"App\User"|Authenticated user class name in which an Event will be associated with. Make sure to include namespacing.|
|user_column|*string*|`null`|Column for the associated user of an Event to be displayed in the front-end. Omitting this option will display their Primary Key by default.|
|loggable_models|*string\|array*|`null`|Ommitting this option will cause Laravel Logger to go through your `app` folder to automatically search for models to track.|
|discover_path|*string*|"app/"|If `loggable_models` is `null`, this config can set the path in which Laravel Logger will automatically search for models to track.|
|discover_namespace|*string*|"App"|If `loggable_models` option is left blank, this option can be set to define the namespace of your `discover_path`.|
|auth_middleware|*string*|"auth"|Middleware name for only allowing authenticated users to access this package.|

### # Configuration - Initialization by Config

This is a list of available sub-options for the `loggable_models` option:

|Option|Type|Required|Default|Description|
|------|----|--------|-------|-----------|
|model|*string*|yes|`null`|Model which is going to be tracked.|
|trackable_attributes|*string\|array*|no|`null`|Which attributes which will be stored when an event happens. If this is not set, it will pull all non-hidden attributes.|
|sync_attributes|*string\|array*|no|`null`|Which attributes will update when syncing model. When this is not set, it will default to `trackable_attributes`. **Columns must exist in model table.**|
|only_when_authenticated|*bool*|no|`false`|Events will only be logged if there is an authenticated user present. This will default to `false` if `tracks_user` is also `false`.|
|tracks_data|*bool*|no|`true`|Are attributes going to be tracked?  Setting `tracks_data` to `false` will overwrite `trackable_attributes` and `sync_attributes` to `[]`.|
|tracks_user|*bool*|no|`true`|Is the authenticated user being tracked?|
|is_favorite|*bool*|no|`false`|Show this model in the beginning of the event's tabs container. Models are sorted by favoritism then alphabetically.|

An advantage of Laravel Logger is that it incorporates Laravel's accessors. 
```php
class MyClass extends Model 
{
    public function getPrettyWeightAttribute()
    {
        return (int) $this->weight / 1.5;
    }
    //...
}
```

Then add the attribute to your `config/laravel_logger.php` options. 
```php
'loggable_models' => [
    [
        'model' => 'App\Model',
        'trackable_attributes' => [...,'pretty_weight',...]
    ],
    //...
],
```
To read more about accessors, check Laravel's [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators)

### # Configuration - Initialization by Model

You can set up `loggable_models` in many different ways. Just passing a string will only track one model and its attributes.   
For example:
```php
'loggable_models' => 'App\MyClass'
//or
'loggable_models' => ['App\MyClass', 'App\SpecialModelNamespace\Team']
```
There are ways you can configure what will be tracked through the model itself. In each file, you can set protected properties which will do the trick for Laravel Logger:
```php
class MyClass extends Model 
{
    protected $trackable_attributes = ['name', 'title', 'role_id', 'salary', 'gender'];
    protected $sync_attributes = ['name', 'title', 'gender'];
    protected $tracks_user = false;
    protected $tracks_data = true;
    protected $is_favorite = true;
    //...
}
```

### # Configuration - Sensitive Data
In case you don't want to store/display sensitive data, you can use Laravel's hidden attributes (or set  `trackable_attributes` config). Laravel Logger will automatically ignore `id, created_at, updated_at`, unless specified.
```php
class MyClass extends Model 
{
    protected $hidden = ['password'];
}
```

## # Events 

### # Events- Middleware
If there are routes in your application where the instace doesn't get updated/deleted/restored, then you have the flexibility to add `log_event` middleware to your routes or controller `__construct()`:

`routes/web.php`
```php
Route::get('/fecthing-model/{model_id}/', 'FetchingController@fetch')->middleware('log_event');
```

`app\Http\Controllers\FecthingController.php`
```php
public function __construct(...)
{
    $this->middleware('log_event')->only('fetch');
}
```

Laravel Logger will parse through the parameters in the request and look for your model instance! The default event name will be `retrieved`. Of course, you can pass a different name like so:

```php
    $this->middleware('log_event:jumped');
```

Just be careful passing `log_event` middleware to methods that update/delete/restore your model instace, since it will be logged multiple times! To read more about middlewares check out Laravel's [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/middleware#introduction)  

### # Events - Filtering

Laravel Logger takes advantages of Server-Side Processing DataTables has to offer. By clicking on individual tags, we can start filtering by them.  

![Tags screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-logger/Screenshot+from+2018-06-18+10-21-34.png)  

Here are some other keywords you can use in the search bar. You can also use regular keywords, which will filter through every record on the table server-sided.

|Keyword|Tags|
|-------|------|
|*tag/tags*|All available tags|
|*users/user*|Authenticated user Primary Key/Column tags|
|*event/events*|All events|
|*activity/activities*|Alias for *event*
|*method/methods*|Method type associated with event|
|*request/requests*|Alias for *method*|

### # Events - Syncing

Laravel Logger can keep track of your model well, but it can also sync your model to a point in time when necessary! You can click on the ID of the model you wish to inspect with more detail.  

![Sync screenshot](https://s3.amazonaws.com/laravel-logger/Screenshot+from+2018-06-18+10-43-14.png)

When you click on the ID of the Model, you are able to see the all time history of the selected ID. If the highlighted history is too far apart to read or there are too many events, then you can slide the top right slider for a more appropriate timeline. You can also hover highlighted sections, which represent an event that took place in the model's timeline.

By clicking on the sync icon, a modal will popup defining which columns will be updated. Check the attribute checkboxes you wish to update and click sync. When syncing, Laravel Logger will create a `SYNC` event instance. It is important to note that `sync_attributes` option need to have valid model's table columns.

### # Events - Model Actions

Laravel Logger gives you a few options out of the box. You can select individual/all rows for archiving/deletion. When an archived row gets deleted it will be **deleted permanently**, so you have been warned! Event deletions are not kept on the record list. Selecting 'all' rows will only select the current page you are in, but you can select a bigger scope (50, 150, 300, 500, All) from the Show dropdown above.

Exporting, in the other hand, will export the whole table. The filters you applied will also be taken into the query.  

`TODO`
* Add middleware section  

## # Testing

None as of yet, sorry guys :(

## # Incoming features

I like to keep it fresh. There are a few ideas I have in mind for this package that I would like to start working on as soon as I have time:  

- Coloring of custom middleware tags
- More options when exporting 
    - Ommiting columns
    - Flexibility to change the date format of 'When' column
- More filtering options
    - Date range/picker
    - Filter by Model ID
- Language & Translations Support
    - Add support for different languages on the front-end
- Tooltips
    - Maybe you have a business manager that wants to use this tool, having help tooltips can be nice
- Compact mode
    - Ommit certain columns so the table is a little more compact
- Cleanup front-end a little more. I know can do better. But hey I'm a developer not a designer, so Bootstrap 4 is what you get for right now
- Bootstrap version control

## # Development

If you have any ideas to contribute or bug fixes in mind: 
  - Fork the repo 
  - Create a PR for me to take a look
